# Udacity---Data-Science-Nanodegree
This is a compilation of everything I learnt in this course.
This article is part of a Udacity Data Science Nanodegree assignment - write a Data Science blog post on Medium. 
As part of this assignment, I have to analyze a data set of my choice and come up with a few questions, that I can answer through my analysis and visualizations. 
I have taken my personal Spotify data (entire data) for this project to answer some questions like “Which are the top artists I listened to?” ,
“Which are the top songs I listened to?”, “Do I like Happy or Sad songs?”, “Do I like Loud songs?” 
While I already know the answers to these questions, it was fun to do this exercise in Python and ‘let the data speak’. 
I accessed the features of my songs from the Spotify API by creating a Spotify App (dummy app used as an interface to Spotify API)
